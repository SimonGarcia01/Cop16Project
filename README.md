# Cop16Project

## Biodiversity Management System (BMS)
### Overview
Welcome to the Biodiversity Management System (BMS) README! This project is my first venture into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), designed to address the challenges posed by the COP16 biodiversity conference, scheduled in Cali from October 21 to November 1, 2024. The BMS serves as a tool for managing crucial information about biodiversity-rich areas, the communities safeguarding them, and the products offered by these communities.

### Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to input, manage, and query data related to biodiversity-rich areas and communities involved in habitat conservation efforts. With the COP16 conference emphasizing the importance of biodiversity conservation, this system aims to facilitate effective management and decision-making processes.

### Functionality
The BMS offers the following functionalities:

#### Data Storage:

Store information about biodiversity-rich areas, including name, department, size, type, inauguration date, photo, caretaking community, required economic resources, and species inhabiting the area.
Manage data about communities, such as name, type, representative's contact, population, major issues, and products offered.

#### Administrative Menu:
Add communities and unique biodiversity-rich areas.
Manage products associated with communities.
Add species to biodiversity-rich areas.
Modify species data in areas.
Create test cases for validation.

#### Query Menu:
Retrieve information about specific biodiversity-rich areas.
List communities within a department.
Identify communities facing specific issues.
Find the area with the highest species count.
List the three largest areas by square kilometer.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several Java classes representing different entities such as places, communities, species and products. Each class encapsulates relevant data and functionalities to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. There is a Ui class that is the Main file that should be executed.

## Instructions to run the program: 
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Java installed.
3. Compile the Java files.
4. Run the main program file to access the administrative and query menus.

## Conclusion
I hope this README provides a clear overview of the BMS project and its functionalities. Feel free to explore the codebase, make improvements, or provide feedback. Thank you for checking out my first OOP project!
